Thoughts on wireless data capture:

What data can we get?
 - Signal strength by device
 - Device to SSID mapping
 - Data rate(s) by device
 - Channel utilization
 - Encryption type
 - Location

What might we get?
 - Distinguish AP vs client vs ad-hoc
 - CRC error rate (probably hardware dependant)
 - Advertised data rates by AP

What is still needed?
 - 802.11 frame parser

How do we output/display all of this data?
ROS:
Visually (graphs):
 - Utilization vs time (single channel)
 - Utilization by device (single channel)
 - Data rate pie chart (single channel or all channels)
 - Channel/bandwidth utilization by SSID (w/encryption)
 - AP strength (single channel)
 - Misbehaving devices: low data rate, high utilization, high CRC rate
 - CRC rate by channel
Heat maps:
 - Min/Max/Average data rate heat maps
 - Channel crowding heat map
 - Signal strength heat map (single channel)
 - Overlap heat map (how many APs on a channel) (single channel or all channels)
 - Utilization heat map
 - SSID coverage/strength maps
 - CRC error rate mapes
Other visualizations:
 - Access point location estimates

Notes:
 - Utilization should take trasmitted data size and transmission rate into
   account.
 - Getting good CRC data is probably dependant on having capture hardware that
   actually reports CRC errors. This will probably require some experimentation
   and comparison with commercial solutions
